`Rule systems were created by rulers to control the mind of those being ruled.
They are meant to distract from the control that is being exercised through them.` ~ _Phundamentals_

`
Feature driven design means reverse engineering, which proves more difficult, especially at the start of an ill-defined application:
you often have a blanc slate to start with and just have to guess how to best implement it.
You get a slice or so of desired functionality without the bigger picture being provided, preventing anyone from establishing some reasonable scope for the application.
Anything is and should remain possible. It's like swimming in a sea of uncertainty.
`

`
Data driven design at least provides some handles and frame of thought from which conclusions can be drawn.
You can start from the question 'What is possible?' instead of starting from a blanc slate.
This provides more guidelines as to what is and what is not feasible and it eliminates some uncertainty by reducing the unknowns.
